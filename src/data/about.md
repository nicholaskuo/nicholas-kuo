# Intro

I am a undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Computer Science, concentrating in artificial intelligence, and minoring in mathematics & entrepreneurship. I dare you to say that line 10 times fast!


My love of technology stems from my ability to build impactful, innovative software to help solve everyday problems of everyday people around the world. I am a full-stack software engineer with a specialization in backend development. I am also skilled in big data analytics, deep learning, and blockchain (still learning new things everyday about the blockchain!). If you think I can be helpful to your organization or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

This summer, I am a Software Engineer Intern at Vanguard, and I am currently developing a full-stack global investment reconciliation platform that will be used by over 270 analysts working in Vanguardâ€™s US, UK, and Australia offices to process more than $500 million in trades daily. On the day to day, I use technologies such as AWS Lambda (in Python language), Amazon EventBridge, DynamoDB NoSQL database, and AWS AppSync (in GraphQL language). I also work heavily in ReactJS (in JavaScript) for frontend UI/UX integrations, as well as backend PostgreSQL relational database design. 


I have worked with people from all around the world, from Lagos, Nigeria to Beijing, China, gaining business insight and strengthening my technical foresight along the way.
